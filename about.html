	<br/> work by WORDS <br/>
	is more like an intro of NORTHY.
	
	</h2>
	
	<div class="projectinfo">
		<p>Northy is an incurable romantic who believes that everyday objects around us also have feelings and “OBJECTALITY”, just like human beings. She builds up imaginary scenarios for everything around her: a HAMSTER, a SOFA, a WINE BOTTLE&GLASS, and so and so.</p>

		<p>She once found a discarded massage chair, took it apart and reupholstered it. Later, she shared the story plot she came up for the chair and collected 86 varations from NARRATORS she picked up on the streets.</p>

		<p>She currently works at WEIDEN+KENNEDY, where she groups with beautiful people to hack TYPEWRITERS to print portraits, 
		</br>or ships FEDEX BOXES filled with shanghai goodies to other wk offices. Sometimes, she still has to jump into the role as an art director to create works for clients like NIKE, TIFFANY, MICHELIN, etc. Before she came to shanghai, she worked with crazy talented people at LITTLEBITS in new york to attack MOMA STORES, making up some of the best times of her life. </p>

		<p>Her academic background is product design. She went to RISD to change her perspective of seeing the world. In the meanwhile, she partnered with her studio mate to design a CODESIGN TOOLBOX for non-designers, powered up an umbrella to rain CATS&DOGS literally, spent some quality time at wood shop to carve an INCENSE VESSEL, or decorated her studio wall with different LIGHTING design.</p>
