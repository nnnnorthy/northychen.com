	<div class="projectinfo">
    <p>Northy is an incurable romantic who believes that everyday objects around us also have feelings and “<a href="objectality.html">OBJECTALITY</a>”, just like human beings. She builds up imaginary scenarios for everything around her: <a href="hamster.html" >a HAMSTER</a>, <a href="sofarecorder.html" target="_blank">a SOFA</a>, <a href="hitme.html">a WINE BOTTLE & a GLASS</a>, and so and so.</p>

		<p>She once found a discarded massage chair, took it apart and reupholstered it. Later, she shared the story plot she came up for the chair and collected 86 varations from <a href="narrator.html">NARRATORS</a> she picked up on the streets.</p>

		<p>She currently works at <a href="http://www.wk.com/" target="_blank">WIEDEN+KENNEDY</a>, where she groups with beautiful people to hack <a href="typeself.html">TYPEWRITERS</a> to print portraits, 
		</br>or ships <a href="fedex.html" >FEDEX BOXES</a> filled with shanghai goodies to other Wieden offices. Sometimes, she still has to jump into the role as an art director to create works for clients like <a href="shm.html" >NIKE</a>, <a href="tiffany.html">TIFFANY</a>, <a href="michelin.html" >MICHELIN</a>, etc. Before she came to shanghai, she worked with crazy talented people at <a href="http://littlebits.cc/" >LITTLEBITS</a> in new york to attack MOMA STORES, making up some of the best times of her life. </p>

		<p>She went to <a href="http://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank">RISD</a> to study Product Design. She partnered with her studio mate to design a <a href="codesign.html">CODESIGN TOOLBOX</a> for non-designers, powered up an umbrella to rain <a href="catsanddogs.html">CATS&DOGS</a> literally, spent some quality time at wood shop to carve an <a href="incenseholder.html">INCENSE VESSEL</a>, or decorated her studio wall with different <a href="lightscape.html">LIGHTING</a> design.</p>
