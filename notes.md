-----------
1. Back button at the bottom of each content page, link is "back to HOMEPAGE" - TODO: go back to text home if came from there.
2. Slide show buttons UX not intuative enough, considerting option based on typeself.cc - TODO: wait for northy's instructions
3. Change home page interaction to 2 pages, by words, and by thumbnails, default thumbnails - DONE
4. Contact by email, use the email address to create a snake game - TODO: code the actual game
5. QRcode mimic effect of an old school webpage flying ad - DONE
6. Mobile layout, different layout
