-----------
1. Back button at the bottom of each content page, link is "back to HOMEPAGE"
2. Slide show buttons UX not intuative enough, considerting option based on typeself.cc
3. Change home page interaction to 2 pages, by words, and by thumbnails, default thumbnails
4. Contact by email, use the email address to create a snake game
5. QRcode mimic effect of an old school webpage flying ad
6. Mobile layout, different layout
